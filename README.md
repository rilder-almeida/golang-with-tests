# Progress

## Go Fundamentals

- [X] Install Go - Set up environment for productivity.

- [X] Hello, world - Declaring variables, constants, if/else statements, switch, write your first go program and write your first test. Sub-test syntax and closures.

- [X] Integers - Further Explore function declaration syntax and learn new ways to improve the documentation of your code.

- [X] Iteration - Learn about for and benchmarking.

- [X] Arrays and slices - Learn about arrays, slices, len, varargs, range and test coverage.

- [X] Structs, methods & interfaces - Learn about struct, methods, interface and table driven tests.

- [X] Pointers & errors - Learn about pointers and errors.

- [X] Maps - Learn about storing values in the map data structure.

- [X] Dependency Injection - Learn about dependency injection, how it relates to using interfaces and a primer on io.

- [X] Mocking - Take some existing untested code and use DI with mocking to test it.

- [X] Concurrency - Learn how to write concurrent code to make your software faster.

- [X] Select - Learn how to synchronise asynchronous processes elegantly.

- [ ] Reflection - Learn about reflection

- [ ] Sync - Learn some functionality from the sync package including WaitGroup and Mutex

- [ ] Context - Use the context package to manage and cancel long-running processes

- [ ] Intro to property based tests - Practice some TDD with the Roman Numerals kata and get a brief intro to property based tests

- [ ] Maths - Use the math package to draw an SVG clock

- [ ] Reading files - Read files and process them

- [ ] Templating - Use Go's html/template package to render html from data, and also learn about approval testing

## Build as application

- [ ] HTTP server - We will create an application which listens to HTTP requests and responds to them.

- [ ] JSON, routing and embedding - We will make our endpoints return JSON and explore how to do routing.

- [ ] IO and sorting - We will persist and read our data from disk and we'll cover sorting data.

- [ ] Command line & project structure - Support multiple applications from one code base and read input from command line.

- [ ] Time - using the time package to schedule activities.

- [ ] WebSockets - learn how to write and test a server that uses WebSockets.

## Questions and answers

- [ ] OS exec - An example of how we can reach out to the OS to execute commands to fetch data and keep our business logic testable.
  
- [ ] Error types - Example of creating your own error types to improve your tests and make your code easier to work with.

- [ ] Context-aware Reader - Learn how to TDD augmenting io.Reader with cancellation. Based on Context-aware io.Reader for Go.

- [ ] Revisiting HTTP Handlers - Testing HTTP handlers seems to be the bane of many a developer's existence. This chapter explores the issues around designing handlers correctly.

## Meta/Discussion

- [ ] Why - Watch a video, or read about why unit testing and TDD is important

- [ ] Intro to generics - Learn how to write functions that take generic arguments and make your own generic data-structure

- [ ] Anti-patterns - A short chapter on TDD and unit testing anti-patterns
